# Cisco ASA 5506-X Firewall Configuration on Packet Tracer

## Description
This project showcases the configuration of the Cisco ASA 5506-X firewall using Cisco Packet Tracer. It demonstrates a full-access firewall setup without any restrictions, making it ideal for learning and simulation purposes. The configuration includes basic routing, NAT, access control lists (ACLs), and security zones to replicate real-world deployment scenarios.

## Objectives
- Configure a fully open ASA 5506-X firewall.
- Understand how to set up NAT and ACLs to secure the network.
- Implement basic routing within the network.
- Simulate a real-world firewall environment to enhance networking and cybersecurity skills.

## Requirements
- Cisco Packet Tracer (compatible version supporting ASA 5506-X).
- Basic knowledge of networking and network security concepts.
- A computer capable of running Packet Tracer smoothly.

## How to Run
1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Load the `.pkt` project file from this repository.
3. Review the ASA 5506-X firewall configuration.
4. Start the simulation and test connectivity across different networks.
5. Examine the settings and learn how NAT and ACLs are configured.

## Project Contents
- The Packet Tracer project file (`.pkt`).
- A folder named `websit` containing 4 HTML pages along with their related images.
- This README file explaining the setup and usage.

## Notes
- This project is intended for learning and training purposes; no strict restrictions or policies are enforced.
- Feel free to modify the project to experiment with different configurations as needed.

If you want, I can also help you with instructions on how to download the project from GitHub or share it with others.

Would you like me to prepare that too?
