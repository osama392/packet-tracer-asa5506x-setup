# Cisco ASA 5506-X Firewall Configuration on Packet Tracer

## Description
This project showcases the configuration of the Cisco ASA 5506-X firewall using Cisco Packet Tracer. It demonstrates a full-access firewall setup without any restrictions, making it ideal for learning and simulation purposes. The configuration includes basic routing, NO NAT,NO access control lists (ACLs), and security zones to replicate real-world deployment scenarios.

## Objectives
- Configure a fully open ASA 5506-X firewall.
- Understand how to set up NAT and ACLs to secure the network.
- Implement basic routing within the network.
- Simulate a real-world firewall environment to enhance networking and cybersecurity skills.

## Requirements
- Cisco Packet Tracer (compatible version supporting ASA 5506-X).
- Basic knowledge of networking and network security concepts.
- A computer capable of running Packet Tracer smoothly.

## How to Run
1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Load the `.pkt` project file from this repository.
3. Review the ASA 5506-X firewall configuration.
4. Start the simulation and test connectivity across different networks.
5. Examine the settings and learn how NAT and ACLs are configured.

## Project Contents
- The Packet Tracer project file (`.pkt`).
- A folder named `websit` containing 4 HTML pages along with their related images.
- This README file explaining the setup and usage.

## Notes
- This project is intended for learning and training purposes; no strict restrictions or policies are enforced.
- Feel free to modify the project to experiment with different configurations as needed.

If you want, I can also help you with instructions on how to download the project from GitHub or share it with others.

Would you like me to prepare that too?
